	<h1>Dynamic Forms built with JavaScript</h1>

<p>
    These forms do not do anything and have very little validation. They solely demonstrate
    how you can use Ext Forms to build and layout forms on the fly.
</p>

<p>The js is not minified so it is readable. See <a href="dynamic.js">dynamic.js</a>.</p>
