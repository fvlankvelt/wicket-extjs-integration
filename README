Fork of the wicket-extjs-integration project
============================================

This fork integrates Wicket with Ext-JS, independent of Hippo CMS.  It provides
a library to create Ext component hierarchies in an intuitive manner and to mix
the ext component hierarchy with the Wicket one.

The original code for the fork can be found at 
  http://code.google.com/p/wicket-extjs-integration/

The intention is to merge this fork back into the original code base.
